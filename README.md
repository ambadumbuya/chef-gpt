# Chef-GPT

**Chef-GPT** is an AI-driven project designed to emulate the expertise of a professional chef. Our goal is to create an intelligent agent capable of providing diverse culinary guidance tailored to various user needs. Chef-GPT can assist with a range of tasks, including:

1. **Ingredient-Based Dish Suggestions**: Offering creative recipe ideas based on the ingredients you have on hand.
2. **Recipe Requests for Specific Dishes**: Delivering detailed recipes for specific dishes upon request.
3. **Recipe Critiques and Improvement Suggestions**: Providing constructive feedback and suggestions to enhance your existing recipes.

## Features

Chef-GPT is designed to support multiple agent personalities, each representing different culinary traditions and expertise. This allows users to interact with specialized AI chefs, enhancing the personalization and authenticity of the cooking experience.
